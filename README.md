The primary goal of this Machine Learning endeavor is to anticipate the rating of a book using a dataset extracted from the Goodreads website, an authentic community of readers.

Foreseeing the rating of a book can be framed as a regression challenge, given that it necessitates forecasting a continuous numerical value—specifically, the mean rating. As a result, employing a Supervised learning approach is apt, as it empowers us to forecast an uninterrupted output variable (the book's rating) grounded in one or more input variables (comprising titles, authors, page count, rating count, publishers, and more).

This examination will be segmented into five core segments:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Visualization
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Modeling
5. Conclusion
